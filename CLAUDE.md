# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

An MkDocs Material site for a quantum computing course textbook. Despite the repo name "quantum_computing", the `docs/prompts/` directory contains course description and concept lists from an EE 2015 "Circuits for Signal Processing" course (used as a template/reference). The actual chapter content in `docs/chapters/` covers quantum computing topics.

Published site: https://AK95AM98.github.io/quantum_computing/

## Build Commands

```bash
mkdocs serve        # Local dev server with live reload (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
mkdocs build        # Build static site to site/ directory
mkdocs gh-deploy    # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Architecture

- **mkdocs.yml** - Site configuration, navigation structure, theme settings, and markdown extensions
- **docs/** - All source content (Markdown)
  - **docs/index.md** - Site homepage
  - **docs/chapters/** - Course chapter content (chapter1.md through chapter21.md), each containing lecture summaries with LaTeX math notation
  - **docs/prompts/** - Course description and concept enumeration prompts with LLM responses; includes `conceptlist.csv` (concept dependency graph in `ConceptID,ConceptLabel,Dependencies` format with pipe-delimited dependency IDs)
- **site/** - Built output (committed to repo, generated by `mkdocs build`)

## Content Conventions

- Chapters use LaTeX math via MathJax (`$$...$$` for display, `$...$` for inline) with Dirac bra-ket notation for quantum states
- Navigation order is defined in `mkdocs.yml` under the `nav:` key
- The site uses `pymdownx.arithmatex` for math rendering, `admonition` for callouts, and `pymdownx.superfences` for fenced code blocks
