## Lecture 1: Introduction to Quantum Physics and Quantum Computing

### Key Concepts:

1. **Fundamental Quantum Principles:**
   - Concepts: Superposition, entanglement, and wave-particle duality.
   - Example: Double-slit experiment and visualization of spin states.
   
2. **Quantum vs. Classical Systems:**
   - Classical bits (binary states: 0 and 1) vs. quantum bits (qubits, which can exist in superposition).
   - Example: A coin with heads or tails (classical) vs. a spinning coin (quantum).
   
3. **Superposition and Measurement:**
   - A qubit can be in a linear combination of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.
   - Measurement collapses the qubit’s state into either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.
   - Example: Using Qiskit to create and measure a superposition state.

## Lecture 2: Basis, Orthonormal Basis, Bra-Ket Notation, and Measurement

### Key Concepts:

1. **Basis States and Orthonormality:**
   - Basis states form the foundation of qubit representation.
   - Orthonormality ensures $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are distinct and normalized.
   - Example: Demonstrating orthogonality of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ through dot product.

2. **Bra-Ket Notation:**
   - “Ket” ($|\ \rangle$) represents a state; “Bra” ($\langle \ |$) is its conjugate transpose.
   - Example: Writing $|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$.

3. **Quantum Measurement:**
   - Probability of measurement is determined by the squared magnitude of coefficients.
   - Example: Simulating measurement of $|\psi\rangle$ using Qiskit’s Aer simulator.

## Lecture 3: Bloch Sphere, Eigenstates, Eigenvectors, Projection Operator

### Key Concepts:

1. **Bloch Sphere Representation:**
   - Visualizing qubit states as points on a unit sphere.
   - Example: Show $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ on the poles; visualize superposition states on the surface.

2. **Eigenstates and Eigenvectors:**
   - Eigenstates of an operator correspond to measurable quantities.
   - Example: Pauli-Z eigenstates are $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.

3. **Projection Operator:**
   - Projects a quantum state onto a particular eigenstate.
   - Example: Project $|\psi\rangle = |0\rangle + |1\rangle$ onto $|0\rangle$ using Qiskit.

## Lecture 4: Binary Data, Qubits, Multi-Qubits, Quantum Gates, and Classical Gates

### Key Concepts:

1. **Single-Qubit Representation:**
   - Binary data encoded into $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.
   - Example: Encode binary “0” as $|0\rangle$ and binary “1” as $|1\rangle$.

2. **Multi-Qubit States:**
   - Tensor products form multi-qubit systems (e.g., $|00\rangle$, $|01\rangle$).
   - Example: Constructing a 2-qubit system in Qiskit.

3. **Quantum Gates:**
   - Operations like X (NOT), H (Hadamard), and Z gates.
   - Example: Apply an H gate to $|0\rangle$ to create superposition.

## Lecture 5: Quantum Circuits and Algorithms

### Key Concepts:

1. **Quantum Circuit Design:**
   - Using Qiskit to construct quantum circuits with gates and measurement.
   - Example: Implementing a basic circuit with Hadamard and CNOT gates.

2. **Quantum Algorithms:**
   - Introduction to algorithms like Deutsch-Josza and Grover's search.
   - Example: Simulate the Deutsch-Josza algorithm to identify constant functions.

## Lecture 6: Quantum Error Correction

### Key Concepts:

1. **Error Sources in Quantum Computing:**
   - Errors from decoherence and gate imperfections.
   - Example: Simulate noise in a quantum circuit with Qiskit.

2. **Error Correction Codes:**
   - Use of redundancy and encoding to detect and correct errors.
   - Example: Implementing the three-qubit bit-flip code in Qiskit.

## Lecture 7: Advanced Topics in Quantum Computing

### Key Concepts:

1. **Quantum Entanglement:**
   - Strong correlations between qubits beyond classical limits.
   - Example: Generate Bell states and verify entanglement properties.

2. **Quantum Cryptography:**
   - Use of quantum principles for secure communication.
   - Example: Simulate the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution.
