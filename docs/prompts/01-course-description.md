Textbook
Electric Circuits, 11th Ed. James Nilsson & Susan Riede. Prentice Hall, 2019. 
EE Notes, Emad Ebbini, on canvas, 2018.
Homework: 40% credit for late homework.

Homework will typically be assigned on Friday and will be due the following Sunday by 10:59pm.  Most homework will be done via the textbook’s website (Mastering Engineering, ME).  Occasionally, we may ask questions via Canvas, where CamScanner, Scanner Pro, or a similar app can be used to create a PDF to upload.

Discussion and collaboration (but not copying!) are encouraged for homework assignments. On canvas HomeWorks and all exams, you MUST show your work to receive any credit (partial or full). Answers without proper units or graphs without the axes labeled will be considered incorrect.

Exams
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. You may NOT use books, cell phones, computers, other communication devices, etc. As stated above, you must show your work to receive partial credit; proper units and labels for graphs are required for full credit. Exam grade concerns or discrepancies must be submitted in writing within 1 week after exams are returned.

Put these in your calendar now. Any reasons to change must be done first week of class:
Exam #1:	Tues Feb 25 		during class  
Exam #2:	Thurs Apr. 3		during class
Final Exam:	Monday May 12           8-10 am (set by university)

Please review the official University of Minnesota Student Code of Conduct.

Grades
Final course grades will be determined based on the following 
12%	Homework
           5%     Discussion attendance
           8%     Quiz (TBD)
25%	Laboratory
15%	Exam 1
15%	Exam 2
20%	Final Exam
The University’s grade definitions can be found here. 

Expected Workload 
EE2015 is a 4-credit course with lecture, laboratory and recitation components. The expected workload for this course is 42 – 45 hours per credit averaged over the course of the semester. This expectation is in accordance with the University Policy found here: https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentwork



Disability Accommodations (DRC website or email drc@umn.edu.)
The University of Minnesota views disability as an important aspect of diversity, and is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.
•	If you have, or think you have, a disability in any area such as, mental health, attention, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical, please contact the DRC office (UM Twin Cities - 612.626.1333) to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations.
•	Students with short-term disabilities, such as a broken arm, can often work with me to minimize classroom barriers. In situations where additional assistance is needed, students should contact the DRC as noted above.
•	If you are registered with the DRC and have a disability accommodation letter dated for this semester or this year, please contact me the first week of class to review how the accommodations will be applied in the course.
•	If I am unable to provide exam accommodations in the department, you will need to schedule them with the DRC and take them in the DRC Testing Center. The Testing Center requires you to schedule exams with at least SEVEN days of advance notice.  To schedule your exams, please complete the online form.
•	If you are registered with the DRC and have questions or concerns about your accommodations, contact your (access consultant/disability specialist).
Mental Health and Stress Management
As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing.  You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via  http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu


EE 2015 Lab Requirements:
The courses EE2015, EE2115, and EE3101 have connected labs. You will need to keep track of all lab kit components that are provided in this course for use in future courses. Parts that are lost or broken need to be purchased by the student at the ECE Depot (ecestock@umn.edu).

You are encouraged to bring your laptop or tablet to the lab for running software and viewing manuals.
