Today we're going to explore some fundamental concepts in quantum computing that help us understand how quantum systems differ from classical systems and the unique properties of quantum operations.</p> <p>\\section{Information Scaling in Classical vs. Quantum Computing}</p> <p>\\textbf{Question:} How does the information content of a computing system scale under classical vs. quantum computing with each extra (q)bit added to the system? How does the picture change after measurement?</p> <p>In \\textbf{classical computing}, we work with bits that can be either 0 or 1. When we add bits to a classical system, the number of possible configurations scales as \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of bits. Each additional bit doubles the number of possible states the system can represent.</p> <p>For example: \\begin{itemize}     \\item 1 bit: 2 possible states (0 or 1)     \\item 2 bits: 4 possible states (00, 01, 10, 11)     \\item 3 bits: 8 possible states \\end{itemize}</p> <p>However, in \\textbf{quantum computing}, qubits can exist in superposition states, meaning an \\(n\\)-qubit system can represent \\(2^n\\) states simultaneously. This property creates exponential scaling potential.</p> <p>Upon \\textbf{measurement}, the superposition collapses to a single classical outcome, meaning we retrieve only one of the possible configurations, reducing the quantum advantage to a classical state.</p> <p>\\section{Quantum Gates and the Bloch Sphere}</p> <p>\\textbf{Question:} Each quantum gate transforms the input state (i.e., the point on the Bloch sphere) to the output state. Each point on the surface of the sphere can represent the outcome of a transformation, thus an infinite number of quantum gates exist. Does this hold for all quantum gates, for an arbitrary number of qubits?</p> <p>For \\textbf{single-qubit systems}, the Bloch sphere provides a complete visualization. Any pure quantum state can be represented as a point on the sphere. Single-qubit quantum gates correspond to rotations or transformations on this sphere. Since these transformations are continuous (described by unitary matrices), there are infinitely many possible single-qubit quantum gates.</p> <p>For \\textbf{multi-qubit systems}, the Bloch sphere representation no longer suffices. A two-qubit system requires a 4-dimensional complex vector space, making it impossible to represent on a simple sphere. Instead, quantum gates operate within this higher-dimensional space using unitary transformations such as the CNOT gate, which entangles qubits and cannot be represented solely on the Bloch sphere.</p> <p>\\section{Measurement Gates and Unitarity}</p> <p>\\textbf{Question:} Does the measurement gate represent a unitary operation?</p> <p>The answer is \\textbf{no}. Measurement is not a unitary operation because: \\begin{enumerate}     \\item Unitary operations preserve probability (\\(U^{\\dagger}U = I\\)).     \\item Unitary operations are reversible, meaning we can determine the input state from the output state. \\end{enumerate}</p> <p>Measurement collapses a quantum state into one of the basis states, irreversibly reducing the quantum superposition into a classical outcome. For example, measuring a qubit in the state \\(\\ket{\\Psi} = \\alpha \\ket{0} + \\beta \\ket{1}\\) yields: \\begin{itemize}     \\item \\(\\ket{0}\\) with probability \\(|\\alpha|^2\\)     \\item \\(\\ket{1}\\) with probability \\(|\\beta|^2\\) \\end{itemize}</p> <p>Since measurement fundamentally changes the system and does not allow for state recovery, it is a non-unitary operation.</p> <p>\\vspace{0.5cm} Any questions before we move on to our next topic? These concepts form the foundation of how we think about quantum information processing and the differences between quantum and classical computing paradigms.</p> <p>\\end{document}</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter3/","title":"Chapter 3: Quantum States","text":"<p>Lecture 3 \\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{amsmath}</p> <p>\\begin{document}</p> <p>\\section{Lecture 3: Bloch Sphere, Eigenstates, Eigenvectors, and Gates}</p> <p>\\subsection*{Additional Key Identities}</p> <p>\\textbf{Pauli-X Gate Identity:} The Pauli-X (NOT) gate can be expressed as a combination of Hadamard (\\( H \\)) and Pauli-Z (\\( Z \\)) gates:</p> <p>$ X = H Z H $</p> <p>Matrix representation of the Pauli-X gate:</p> <p>$ X = \\begin{bmatrix}  0 &amp; 1 \\  1 &amp; 0  \\end{bmatrix} $</p> <p>\\subsection*{Hadamard Gate}</p> <p>The Hadamard gate creates superposition states:</p> <p>$ H |0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle), \\quad H |1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle) $</p> <p>Matrix representation:</p> <p>$ H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} $</p> <p>\\subsection*{Bloch Sphere Representation}</p> <p>A qubit state can be visualized on the Bloch Sphere as:</p> <p>$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} |0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi} \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} |1\\rangle $</p> <p>where: \\begin{itemize}     \\item \\( \\theta \\) determines the relative contribution of \\( |0\\rangle \\) and \\( |1\\rangle \\).     \\item \\( \\phi \\) represents the phase difference between \\( |0\\rangle \\) and \\( |1\\rangle \\). \\end{itemize}</p> <p>\\subsection*{Eigenstates and Eigenvectors of Pauli-Z Gate}</p> <p>\\textbf{Pauli-Z Operator (\\( Z \\)) Eigenstates:}</p> <p>$ Z |0\\rangle = +|0\\rangle, \\quad Z|1\\rangle = -|1\\rangle $</p> <p>Matrix representation:</p> <p>$ Z = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} $</p> <p>\\subsection*{Eigenstates and Eigenvectors of Pauli-X Gate}</p> <p>\\textbf{Pauli-X Operator (\\( X \\)) Eigenstates:}</p> \\[\\begin{equation}     X |\\pm\\rangle = \\pm |\\pm\\rangle \\end{equation}\\] <p>where the eigenstates are:</p> <p>$ |+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad |-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} $</p> <p>\\subsection*{Projection Operators}</p> <p>A projection operator projects a state onto a specific eigenstate:</p> <p>For example, if we consider a system with eigenstates \\( |0\\rangle \\) and \\( |1\\rangle \\), the projection operators are:</p> <p>$ P_0 = |0\\rangle \\langle 0| = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad P_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} $</p> <p>The probability of measuring \\( |0\\rangle \\) or \\( |1\\rangle \\):</p> <p>$ P(|0\\rangle) = |\\langle 0 | \\psi \\rangle |^2, \\quad P(|1\\rangle) = |\\langle 1 | \\psi \\rangle |^2 $</p> <p>\\subsection*{Two-Qubit Systems and CNOT Gate}</p> <p>A general two-qubit state can be written as:</p> <p>$ |\\psi\\rangle = c_{00}|00\\rangle + c_{01}|01\\rangle + c_{10}|10\\rangle + c_{11}|11\\rangle $</p> <p>where the coefficients satisfy:</p> <p>$ |c_{00}|^2 + |c_{01}|^2 + |c_{10}|^2 + |c_{11}|^2 = 1 $</p> <p>Matrix representation of the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate:</p> <p>$ CNOT = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} $</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter4/","title":"Chapter 4: New Quantum","text":"<p>\\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb, graphicx} \\usepackage{qcircuit}</p> <p>\\title{Lecture 1: Fundamentals of Quantum States and Measurements} \\date{February 24, 2025}</p> <p>\\begin{document} \\maketitle</p> <p>\\section{Introduction} Quantum computing relies on quantum mechanics principles to manipulate information.

The University of Minnesota views disability as an important aspect of diversity, and is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. \u2022   If you have, or think you have, a disability in any area such as, mental health, attention, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical, please contact the DRC office (UM Twin Cities - 612.626.1333) to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. \u2022   Students with short-term disabilities, such as a broken arm, can often work with me to minimize classroom barriers. In situations where additional assistance is needed, students should contact the DRC as noted above. \u2022   If you are registered with the DRC and have a disability accommodation letter dated for this semester or this year, please contact me the first week of class to review how the accommodations will be applied in the course. \u2022   If I am unable to provide exam accommodations in the department, you will need to schedule them with the DRC and take them in the DRC Testing Center. The Testing Center requires you to schedule exams with at least SEVEN days of advance notice.  To schedule your exams, please complete the online form. \u2022   If you are registered with the DRC and have questions or concerns about your accommodations, contact your (access consultant/disability specialist). Mental Health and Stress Management As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing.

This expectation is in accordance with the University Policy found here: https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentwork</p> <p>Disability Accommodations (DRC website or email drc@umn.edu.) The University of Minnesota views disability as an important aspect of diversity, and is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. \u2022   If you have, or think you have, a disability in any area such as, mental health, attention, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical, please contact the DRC office (UM Twin Cities - 612.626.1333) to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. \u2022   Students with short-term disabilities, such as a broken arm, can often work with me to minimize classroom barriers. In situations where additional assistance is needed, students should contact the DRC as noted above. \u2022   If you are registered with the DRC and have a disability accommodation letter dated for this semester or this year, please contact me the first week of class to review how the accommodations will be applied in the course. \u2022   If I am unable to provide exam accommodations in the department, you will need to schedule them with the DRC and take them in the DRC Testing Center. The Testing Center requires you to schedule exams with at least SEVEN days of advance notice.  To schedule your exams, please complete the online form. \u2022   If you are registered with the DRC and have questions or concerns about your accommodations, contact your (access consultant/disability specialist). Mental Health and Stress Management As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing.
